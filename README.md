# Deuces - React/Typescript implementation of [Big 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two)

## Folder Structure

Since this application is created using create-react-app with a typescript template, the top level structure should be familiar: a `public` directory where we can put our static content for direct access, and a `src` directory which will contain our source code for the project. I also like to keep references, diagrams and other artifacts in a `refs` directory for easy access while developing out the project. Once we build the project, we will have a `build` directory for production ready assets.

### `src` directory

The `src` directory is divided into four top level directories: `deuces`, `ui`, `test`, and `utils`.
